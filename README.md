# Virtual DOM Example

This repository contains a simple Virtual DOM example demonstrating the creation, rendering, and updating of a virtual DOM representation in JavaScript.

## Introduction

This example showcases the implementation of a Virtual DOM, which is a simplified representation of the DOM in memory. It efficiently updates the real DOM by minimizing direct manipulations, enhancing performance in complex applications.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. Open the index.html file in a web browser.

3. Observe the Virtual DOM example in action, where the displayed count updates every second.
